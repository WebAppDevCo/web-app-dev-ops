# web-app-dev-ops
Project demonstrating deploying Angular 5 .NET Core to Azure Kubernetes Cluster in Docker Container. I published this so the template mods I made could be viewed and might be heloful for other projects. Each project should be opened separately in Visual Studio via solution file and should really be in their own repo. The online sample URL http://www.webappdevops.com. Changes to this repo will not push to the CI/CD pipeline, as that is a private repo. I have included exports of the build and release pipelines for WebAppDevOps.Web in the root.
